Implement an iterator over a binary search tree(BST).
Your iterator will be initiallized with the root node of a BST.

Calling next() will return the next smallest number in the BST.

Note: next() and hasNext() should run in average O(1) time and uses O(n) 
memeory, where h is the height of the tree.
